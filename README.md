# Algorithms and Data Structures

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/MaikelVeen/algorithms-datastructures.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/MaikelVeen/algorithms-datastructures)

This repository contains implementations for common data structures and algorithms. The code was initially part of the 'Development 6A' course at the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences. I will be expanding upon it in the future. The algorithms and data structures are accomponied with xUnit Test. Not everything is implemented yet and some code needs refactoring and cleanup.
